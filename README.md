# Credit Card Fraud Detection

* For the Risk & Fraud class of the Master's in Big Data we were tasked to implement `scikit-learn` classification algorithms to detect credit card fraud cases
* Performed feature selection by taking a look at relationships ans correlations between my data 
* Corrected class imbalance using `upsampling` instead of `downsampling` to avoid information loss
* Designed train-test-evaluate cycle for final model selection
* GINI score was used as the principal evaluation metric
